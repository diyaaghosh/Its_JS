- Individual folders for each project with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Clean and beginner-friendly project implementations
- Live demos and source code access for every project

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on learning, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain a structured record of JavaScript practice projects.
